# IoT
This my final year project Automated Irrigation system using IoT,

  ▪ Designed and developed an IoT-based automated irrigation system. Monitored real-time soil moisture levels to optimize watering efficiency.
  
  ▪ Utilized the Arduino IDE as the development environment for programming and interfacing. and the C++ programming language to facilitate communication between Arduino and 
    sensors.
    
  ▪ Implemented an automatic control mechanism to activate a water pump when soil moisture dropped below a certain threshold and deactivate it when the soil reached the 
    desired moisture level. Demonstrated expertise in creating an efficient and water-saving irrigation solution.
